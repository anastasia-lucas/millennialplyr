## What is this?

`millennialplyr` is an alternative syntax for `dplyr` that replaces sane function names with Millennial & 00s slang. Inspired by [genzplyr](https://hadley.github.io/genzplyr/) and [boomerply](https://github.com/bradlindblad/boomerplyr)


## Installation


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anastasia-lucas/millennialplyr")
